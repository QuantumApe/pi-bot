Scratchpad for working on my Raspberry Pi robot

This code is very alpha and basic

Use at your own risk

PiClient:
This folder contins the python code for the client that connects to the server. It basicly sends keyboard input to the PiServer.


PiServer:
This folder contains the code that sits on the rasberry pi and controls the robot. Be sure you know what pins are assigned to what before using!
