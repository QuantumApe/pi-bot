 This project contains the code for my raspberry pi robot. 
 It is very much in alpha, use at your own risk.
 
 PiClient
 Used to connect to PiServer to send keyboard key presses. This verson only supports linux.
 Right now it uses wasd keys to move.
 
 PiServer
 Runs on the Raspberry Pi, and controls it's movement from the PiClient.
